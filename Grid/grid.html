                    <p>The festival of Colors is celebrated all over India since ancient times. Originally, the festival
                        was an agricultural festival, celebrating the arrival of spring. It represents throwing off the
                        gloom of winter and enjoying the liveliness of spring. The legend associated with the festival
                        involves an evil king called Hiranyakashipu. He forbade his son from worshipping Vishnu.
                        However, Radhu proceeded offering prayers to the gods. Hiranyakashipu challenged Prahlad to sit
                        on a pyre with his aunt Holika who was to be immune to fire. When the fire started, Holika was
                        burnt to death whereas Prahlad survived without a scar. Burning Holika is celebrated as Holi.
                        The morning after also known as Rangwali Holi is where people smear each other with colors and
                        enjoy delicious gujiyas together, sharing the love. Water guns and water-filled balloons are
                        also a part of the celebrations, making every moment of the event memorable.
